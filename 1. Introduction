console.log("- Benefits: Increased productivity, reduced learning curve, and improved code quality.");
console.log("- Personas: Novice programmers, domain experts with programming needs but no coding background.");
console.log("- Dependencies: Integration with natural language processing libraries or APIs.");

console.log("Feature 2: Code Generation");
console.log("- Description: The tool should generate code snippets based on the user's natural language input.");
console.log("- Background: Advanced algorithms and code templates will be used to generate relevant code based on the user's intention.");
console.log("- Business and product goals: Automate code writing, reduce programming errors, and improve code consistency.");
console.log("- Problem: Users spend significant time and effort translating their requirements into code manually, which leads to errors and inefficiencies.");
console.log("- Benefits: Increased productivity, reduced programming effort, and improved code quality.");
console.log("- Personas: Both novice and experienced programmers looking for a more efficient way to generate code.");
console.log("- Dependencies: Robust code generation algorithms and code template libraries.");

console.log("Feature 3: Language Support");
console.log("- Description: The tool should support multiple programming languages.");
console.log("- Background: Different programming languages have unique syntax and requirements, so the tool should be flexible enough to handle various languages.");
console.log("- Business and product goals: Support a wide range of users with different language preferences.");
console.log("- Problem: Users often work with different programming languages and need a tool that can cater to their language of choice.");
console.log("- Benefits: Increased user adoption, expanded user base, and improved user satisfaction.");
console.log("- Personas: Developers working with different programming languages across various domains.");
console.log("- Dependencies: Integration with language-specific code libraries and knowledge bases.");

console.log("Feature 4: Error Handling and Feedback");
console.log("- Description: The tool should provide helpful error messages and feedback when the input cannot be accurately translated into code.");
console.log("- Background: Error handling and informative feedback will improve the user experience and guide users to provide valid instructions.");
console.log("- Business and product goals: Enhance user satisfaction and reduce frustration by providing clear guidance in the case of invalid or ambiguous input.");
console.log("- Problem: Users may encounter errors or receive incorrect code snippets, leading to confusion and wasted time.");
console.log("- Benefits: Improved usability, reduced user frustration, and enhanced code accuracy.");
console.log("- Personas: All users who interact with the tool and encounter errors or receive unexpected results.");
console.log("- Dependencies: Error detection algorithms, user-friendly error messaging system.");

console.log("Feature 5: Integration with Code Editors");
console.log("- Description: The tool should seamlessly integrate with popular code editors and development environments.");
console.log("- Background: Integration with code editors will enable users to directly insert generated code snippets into their projects.");
console.log("- Business and product goals: Streamline the code writing process and improve workflow efficiency.");
console.log("- Problem: Users typically switch between different applications when writing code, which disrupts their workflow.");
console.log("- Benefits: Improved productivity, reduced context switching, and enhanced user experience.");
console.log("- Personas: Developers and programmers who use code editors or integrated development environments (IDEs).");
console.log("- Dependencies: APIs or extensions for popular code editors or IDEs.");

console.log("Feature 6: Version Control and History");
console.log("- Description: The tool should maintain a history of user interactions and provide version control for generated code snippets.");
console.log("- Background: Version control will allow users to track changes, compare different code versions, and revert to previous versions if needed.");
console.log("- Business and product goals: Improve collaboration, enable experimentation, and provide a safety net for code modifications.");
console.log("- Problem: Users often make changes to their code and may need to access previous versions or collaborate with others.");
console.log("- Benefits: Enhanced team collaboration, improved code management, and increased code reliability.");
console.log("- Personas: Developers or teams working on shared code repositories or collaborative projects.");
console.log("- Dependencies: Version control systems or libraries integration.");

console.log("The Chat2Code tool has several non-functional requirements that contribute to its overall performance, security, usability, compatibility, and accessibility.");

console.log("The assumptions and constraints of the Chat2Code tool are as follows:");

console.log("Assumption 1: Users have a basic understanding of programming concepts and logic.");
console.log("Assumption 2: The availability and reliability of natural language processing libraries or APIs.");
console.log("Constraint 1: Limited development resources or budget.");
console.log("Constraint 2: The tool may not be able to generate complex or highly domain-specific code snippets.");
