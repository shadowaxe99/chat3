// Feature 1: Natural Language Processing
// Description: The tool should be able to understand and interpret natural language descriptions of programming tasks.
// Background: Natural language processing techniques will be leveraged to transform the user's instructions into a machine-readable format.
// Business and product goals: Improve user accessibility by removing the barrier of having to learn programming languages and syntax.
// Problem: Users with limited programming knowledge struggle to convert their ideas into code due to the syntax requirements of programming languages.
// Benefits: Increased productivity, reduced learning curve, and improved code quality.
// Personas: Novice programmers, domain experts with programming needs but no coding background.
// Dependencies: Integration with natural language processing libraries or APIs.

// Feature 2: Code Generation
// Description: The tool should generate code snippets based on the user's natural language input.
// Background: Advanced algorithms and code templates will be used to generate relevant code based on the user's intention.
// Business and product goals: Automate code writing, reduce programming errors, and improve code consistency.
// Problem: Users spend significant time and effort translating their requirements into code manually, which leads to errors and inefficiencies.
// Benefits: Increased productivity, reduced programming effort, and improved code quality.
// Personas: Both novice and experienced programmers looking for a more efficient way to generate code.
// Dependencies: Robust code generation algorithms and code template libraries.

// Feature 3: Language Support
// Description: The tool should support multiple programming languages.
// Background: Different programming languages have unique syntax and requirements, so the tool should be flexible enough to handle various languages.
// Business and product goals: Support a wide range of users with different language preferences.
// Problem: Users often work with different programming languages and need a tool that can cater to their language of choice.
// Benefits: Increased user adoption, expanded user base, and improved user satisfaction.
// Personas: Developers working with different programming languages across various domains.
// Dependencies: Integration with language-specific code libraries and knowledge bases.

// Feature 4: Error Handling and Feedback
// Description: The tool should provide helpful error messages and feedback when the input cannot be accurately translated into code.
// Background: Error handling and informative feedback will improve the user experience and guide users to provide valid instructions.
// Business and product goals: Enhance user satisfaction and reduce frustration by providing clear guidance in the case of invalid or ambiguous input.
// Problem: Users may encounter errors or receive incorrect code snippets, leading to confusion and wasted time.
// Benefits: Improved usability, reduced user frustration, and enhanced code accuracy.
// Personas: All users who interact with the tool and encounter errors or receive unexpected results.
// Dependencies: Error detection algorithms, user-friendly error messaging system.

// Feature 5: Integration with Code Editors
// Description: The tool should seamlessly integrate with popular code editors and development environments.
// Background: Integration with code editors will enable users to directly insert generated code snippets into their projects.
// Business and product goals: Streamline the code writing process and improve workflow efficiency.
// Problem: Users typically switch between different applications when writing code, which disrupts their workflow.
// Benefits: Improved productivity, reduced context switching, and enhanced user experience.
// Personas: Developers and programmers who use code editors or integrated development environments (IDEs).
// Dependencies: APIs or extensions for popular code editors or IDEs.

// Feature 6: Version Control and History
// Description: The tool should maintain a history of user interactions and provide version control for generated code snippets.
// Background: Version control will allow users to track changes, compare different code versions, and revert to previous versions if needed.
// Business and product goals: Improve collaboration, enable experimentation, and provide a safety net for code modifications.
// Problem: Users often make changes to their code and may need to access previous versions or collaborate with others.
// Benefits: Enhanced team collaboration, improved code management, and increased code reliability.
// Personas: Developers or teams working on shared code repositories or collaborative projects.
// Dependencies: Version control systems or libraries integration.
